# Create your own portfolio

1. Fork the repository ( Recommended )
2. Change the repository name to `your-github-username.github.io` by going into settings
3. Clone the repository using `git clone YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL`
4. Modify the variables in `src/lib/DynamicValues.ts` to add your own data and flavors.
5. Run: `npm run predeploy` or `yarn predeploy`
6. Run: `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`
7. Check the `settings` of your repository, and change the `source` of the github pages to `master` branch

& Volla!! Now, you can check your portfolio LIVE version in the `homepage` URL (`https://your-github-username.github.io/`). Github may take a while to update the `github page` into your `homepage` URL.

If it still doesn't show, do step 5 & 6 again. It usually takes 3-5 minutes for github pages to deploy the changes.
